# Kevin Muncie's personal start package for [Bulma](http://bulma.io)

## Insipration for this project

This project is inspired by the [bulma-start](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma-start) package built by Jeremy Thomas. I took that simple
start and reconfigured it to fit my personal approaches and methodologies.

Check the `package.json` file to see the dependencies and build processes utilized.

## Development

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run develop` during development to watch files
- Run `npm run generate` to generate a clean dist folder ready to upload to the hosting of your choice

In order to view the site locally for development or testing you will need to run a webserver pointing at the `dist` folder. I normally do
this with [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
