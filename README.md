# Kevin Muncie's personal start package for [Bulma](http://bulma.io)

## Insipration for this project

This project is inspired by the [bulma-start](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma-start) package built by Jeremy Thomas. I took that simple
start and reconfigured it to fit my personal approaches and methodologies.

Check the `package.json` file to see the dependencies and build processes utilized.

## Development

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run develop` during development to watch files
